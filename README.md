# CS526TermProject

Project for CS 526 Data Structures and Algorithms.

Name: Priority Queue simulator.

Description: Command-line application to simulate process scheduling with Java's default PriorityQueue<E>. Application reads data from an input file that contains each process' ID, priority, duration, and arrival time. Process data is stored as a Process object, with getter and setter methods allowing for the retrieval of data related to applicable fields. In determining the order of processes to be added / removed from the queue, the application takes into account the priority along with the arrival, wait and duration times of each process in the queue.
